+Code the following app
+```
+Create a "Whac-a-Mole" style arcade game with a keyboard-controlled twist. Instead of a single mallet, the player will control four different characters (or "moles") simultaneously, each assigned to one of the four primary arrow keys: the Up arrow key controls a character in the top position, the Down arrow for the bottom, Left for the left side, and Right for the right side. These characters will pop up randomly from their designated holes or spawn points. The core gameplay loop involves the player pressing the correct arrow key as soon as the corresponding character appears on screen. For a successful hit, the character should play a fun animation (like a bonk or a squish), a satisfying sound effect should play, and the score should increase. The game must include a clear and prominent score counter displayed at the top of the screen. Additionally, please implement a control panel with three distinct buttons: a "Start" button to begin the game, a "Pause" button to temporarily freeze the action (which can then be changed to a "Resume" button), and a "Reset" button that immediately stops the current game and clears the score back to zero, ready for a new round. The visual style should be bright, colorful, and cartoonish to enhance the arcade feel.

+Structure the game's interface as a grid of four large, interactive boxes that visually mimic the physical layout of the keyboard's arrow key cluster. Position three boxes on a bottom row, labeled "LEFT", "DOWN", and "RIGHT" from left to right. Place a single "UP" box centered directly above the "DOWN" box, completing the classic "T" shape.

+The player should start with 3 HP.
+Each time the player presses the wrong key or fails to press the correct key, reduce HP by 1.
+If HP reaches 0, trigger the Game Over sequence that already exists (or create one if needed) and reset the score back to 0.
+This new HP system must integrate smoothly with the current code structure.
